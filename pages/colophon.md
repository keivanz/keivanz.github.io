This site was coded by Keivan. Sharing how I did it in case you're on a similiar journey:

### Infrastructure
* This site was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Read more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/git-integration/#github-2) on how to connect the two.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework.


### Components
* [Dark mode color switcher](https://github.com/404GamerNotFound/bootstrap-5.3-dark-mode-light-mode-switch)
* Icons:  
* Fonts
   * [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
   * Serif
* Quote randomizer was built through Gemini
* [Colors: Flexoki system](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
