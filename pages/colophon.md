Sharing how I pulled together this site in case you're on a similiar journey:

### Infrastructure
* This site was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Read more](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) on how to connect the two.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the CSS framework.


### Components
* [Dark mode color switcher](https://github.com/404GamerNotFound/bootstrap-5.3-dark-mode-light-mode-switch)
* [Icons via Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
* Fonts
   * [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)
   * Source Serif 4
* Quote randomizer was built through Gemini
* [Colors: Flexoki system](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
