- quote: "We can get fixated on solving problems one way, missing simpler solutions. Inversion breaks us out of this tunnel vision. Instead of asking yourself "How do I solve this?", inversion asks, "What would guarantee failure?" Rather than "How can I achieve this?" it asks "What's preventing me from achieving it?" This flip reveals insights our usual thinking overlooks."
